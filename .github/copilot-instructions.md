# Copilot Instructions for Songbird

## Project Overview

Songbird is an ambient sound synthesis framework written in Rust. It orchestrates multiple concurrent audio voices with probabilistic sample scheduling, stereo panning, and hot-reloadable YAML configuration.

### Core Architecture

The system is organized into modular layers:
- **Voices**: Two playback modes (continuous overlapping samples and discrete event-driven mode)
- **Audio**: Buffers, stereo mixing with panning, and platform audio output abstraction
- **Samples**: WAV file loading and in-memory caching
- **Config**: YAML parsing, validation, and file watching for hot-reload
- **Engine**: Main orchestrator coordinating voices, mixing, and output

## Build, Test, and Lint Commands

### Building
```bash
cargo build                 # Debug build
cargo build --release      # Optimized release build
```

### Testing
```bash
cargo test                 # Run all tests
cargo test --lib          # Run library tests only
cargo test -- --nocapture # Run with output displayed
cargo test <test_name>    # Run a specific test by name
```

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
cargo clippy              # Lint with Clippy
cargo clippy --fix        # Auto-fix Clippy warnings
cargo fmt                 # Format code with Rustfmt
cargo fmt -- --check      # Check formatting without modifying
```

### Checking
```bash
cargo check               # Fast check without building
```

## Key Conventions

- **Edition**: Rust 2024 edition
- **Code style**: Standard Rust conventions; enforced with `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- **Testing**: Unit tests co-located with implementation; run with `cargo test --lib`
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only essential crates used (serde, serde_yaml, rand, notify, wav)
- **Module structure**: Public API exported via mod.rs in each module; internal types use `pub use`

## Voice Concepts

- **Continuous Mode**: Probabilistically selects and overlaps multiple samples from a pool (e.g., water splattering)
- **Discrete Mode**: Event-driven playback of individual, non-overlapping samples (e.g., rain drops, bird chirps)
- **Pan**: Stereo positioning from -1.0 (full left) to 1.0 (full right), 0.0 (center)

## Notes

- Phases 1-3 complete: modules, types, and tests in place
- Phases 4-7 focus on mixing/panning, audio output, config hot-reload, and CLI
- Stub implementations exist for file watching (Phase 6); integrate with notify crate when reached
- OS audio output layer (Phase 5) uses minimal abstraction for future portability
